## Data Sources

**Sample data is already included**, but the descriptions of each dataset, and the steps taken to get them, are outlined below.

### EASIUR:
>"The Estimating Air pollution Social Impact Using Regression (EASIUR) model is an easy-to-use tool estimating the social cost (or public health cost) of emissions in the United States. The EASIUR model was derived using regression on a large dataset created by CAMx, a state-of-the-art chemical transport model. The EASIUR closely reproduce the social costs of emissions predicted by full CAMx simulations but without the high computational costs." 

The marginal social costs provided by EASIUR are functions of population age, income, and the USD value. The data provided is for 2020 population and income, in 2010 USD. An inflation rate of 1.2 is used to estimate these costs in 2020 USD (applied in `easiur.py`, after processing)

To get EASIUR Data:
1. Run `getEasiurLocs.py` from the `data/easiur_msc` directory. This script will pull the locations of every power plant in the United States and compile them in a CSV file. It does not include generators with no latitude/longitude locations, and it fixes a latitude typo for plant #62242 in New York. This file is used in conjuction with the EASIUR Online Data Access Tool.
2. Go to the [EASIUR Online Tool](https://barney.ce.cmu.edu/~jinhyok/easiur/online/) [1,2], and use the batch conversion tool by uploading the file generated by `getEasiurLocs.py`. Each line of the output file contains a location and the corresponding Marginal Social Cost of 4 pollutants
3. Move the output file back to `data/easiur_msc`, then run the `processEasiur.py`.

### EIA Annual Emissions
This [dataset](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/emissions/) [3] provides *annual* unit-level generation and emissions (CO2, NOx, and SO2). 

### EIA-860 
>"The survey Form EIA-860 collects generator-level specific information about existing and planned generators and associated environmental equipment at electric power plants with 1 megawatt or greater of combined nameplate capacity. Summary level data can be found in the Electric Power Annual."
